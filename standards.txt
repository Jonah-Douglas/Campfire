# API Resources design
We are using python's fastAPI backend framework. We are using OpenAPI's Swagger for creating and 
maintaining documentation for the Campfire API. We are utilizing sqlalchemy alongside pydantic for 
creating our ORM, and database migrations are being performed by Alembic on our PostgreSQL database.

Below are some standards for creating new resources within the API.

-All requests should define a summary and a response_description.
-All requests that require a body should create an example body with a real world example.
