Event aggregation and exploration app. For my MVP I am simply creating an app where users can create 
events, match up on events and be entered into a messaging group for the given event. I will have users, 
system created events, user created events, user profiles and an authentication/authorization process. 
More to come!

# Campfire Project - BackEnd

## Requirements

* Setup your python venv, then run "pip install -r .\requirements.txt"

## Local Development

* Built with a PostgreSQL db in mind, with db migrations via Alembic
* I'd recommend setting this up to bounce off localhost for now, still setting up Docker and AWS hosting
* Make sure you have latest python & pip outside of the requirements file listed

### Docker TODO

### Backend Tests TODO

### Alembic Migrations TODO
